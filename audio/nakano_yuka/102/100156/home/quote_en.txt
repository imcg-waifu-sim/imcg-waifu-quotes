It is a microwave oven that melts the chocolate ... is it okay?
I am not dexterous and I am almost new to making sweets, but ... I experienced everything!
It is still skillful to challenge the cake ... No no ... It's a challenge, challenge!
Is not it bitter or milk? Rather than being bitter, I wonder if it is sweet
There were twists and turns, but somehow shaped ...! Haa ... it was good ...
I learn daily, seem to find new me ... It is an irreplaceable experience
I do not usually get on ... this apron was also new. Are you becoming like?
[Producer] san! Can I ask for a taste!
If you break chocolate please leave it!
Does it lather! Can you hold down the bowl so that it does not fly!
Heart 's chocolate ... ... [Producer], if you eat it ...
Because what the [Producer] gave is engraved on my chest!
