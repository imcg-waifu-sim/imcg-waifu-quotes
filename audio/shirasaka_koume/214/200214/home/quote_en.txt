over here……. I was surprised…?
My chest hurts ...? Overworked…? Oh, it's pounding ...?
With only the lights on hand, my eyes will get worse .... But, there are things that can be seen ...?
I came to pick up ... The night road ... Because I was with that girl, I do not mind ...
[Producer] 's whereabouts ... taught me ...
I was waiting forever .... Waiting ... It was fun ... pounding out
What is behind me? There is nothing but ...? Or ... did you see?
Do you feel something ...? By the way, the air is cool .... Air conditioning is stopping ...
If you turn off the light ... something happens. …erase. But do not regret it
When I listen, I hear you .... Look, cute laughter ... giggle
If you work late this way, I will come and visit you. Me too ... besides ...
[Producer] and that child will get along well ... I'm happy ...
