It's a crimson red sea ... I have never seen it ... happy ...
A lot of light ... everyone 's soul is shaking .... Fluctuate ...
Outside world that was Yutsu ... There are lots of light now ... It is beautiful ...
Heia's songs will not sing ... It's a horror and a mystery than that ... a magical world
I will tell you the world that [Producer] can not see ...
I came to idle. ... My feelings, I wonder if it was transmitted
It is not birds that are attached to the scarf, bats ... patapata ...
I do not want the sunlight, but ... the light of the venue may like .... From warm ...
When you shake ... the water drops on the web of the spider are shit ... Will it turn red?
I guess those girls are like Sagashita ... Omaheda!
I'm pointing at [Producer] .... Even if I am in the distance, I feel it ...
Let's play together. I will do my best to help you excitement. Yayâ€¦
