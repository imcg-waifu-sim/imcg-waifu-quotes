Everyone gathers under the sun ... That girl is in the shade in the shade
I wonder why, I can brighten up with everyone .... Is this the mystery answer ...?
Is it only fun of children like this? Let's have fun
I drew street art with everyone. Vividly, decorate freely â™ª
[Producer] always gives you hints
Now that [Producer] makes, I was also able to be with me ... Eh
It's not like me, but it seems to me
Leaning crawling ... Now, under the sun. ... It's going on little by little
T - shirts are the same, but not the same .... Is it a super high-end Corde?
Sing freely, dance. Everyone is totally different ... that's good ...
The answer is in myself .... [Producer] made me realize
I might rather relax than other children .... Still, because it crawls properly
