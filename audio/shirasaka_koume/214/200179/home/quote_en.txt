I am scared of not being able to see the end. But, maybe it's interesting ...
As I sing, something seems to get out of my heart. It is not a zombie?
Next time, I want to help everyone who helped me .... That is ... companion ...?
I can see Mr. Kawashima. What I can not see .... Feelings put in the song ...
I have to sing a lot and see .... As I taught [Producer],
It is not kill you loving you .... [Producer], that ...
This dress ... I can not make it a red one ... Huhuu
More, with a sad face. Oh, feeling to lower the eyebrows? Huh?
It's trembling ... right? If it's a nice song, the heart will be broken ...
Eh ... behind ... Anyone here? Know. Everyone, are not they
It is the [Producer] who always opens the key and saves me ...
Thank you, [Producer]. Thanks and well ... I could sing ...
