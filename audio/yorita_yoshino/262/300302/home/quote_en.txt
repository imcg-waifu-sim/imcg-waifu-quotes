Feel the warmth of the hot water overflowing from Oyama. Wow
You can give us strength from everything. Healing also
Too much noise makes us worried, but ... Phew ...
The magnificent landscape reminds me of my hometown mountains. It is similar to the wind
Huh Forever wish to be immersed in this warmth
Warmth will be filled in my heart as well. Let me share it later
Both of them can not get to their shoulders. I will count one hundred. I love you ...
A comfortable wind seems to have blown. Here, stroke your hair
Go around the mountains, be happy that we have reached here, beat me
The leaves turn beautifully - and the next season will come ... ... what to go around ...
We are getting warmer power than flowing hot water. In this hand ... haha
Have you been healed too? Hehehe, I wish I had a good time.
