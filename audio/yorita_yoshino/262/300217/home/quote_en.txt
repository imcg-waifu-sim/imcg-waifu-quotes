Your feelings called me -. I was waiting
It's almost like a temple, no, no matter how many times we pray, that place is in the temple
The enjoyment is similar to prayers. There is a pure heart filled -
If my dance and song heals and cleanses everyone 's heart. Saka
I wish it would be like my hometown home. This feeling is so, love and
It is beautiful that everyone's smile is blooming. It seems my heart is filled
Yoshino is nearby so close by. It is safe
Touching everyone's heart, I feel the soul cleanses -
Like these flowers boldly - Blooming and proud. Round and round
To the termo, I spin with soul. That's the reason for work
I am nothing. Because there are more ones you will have
The flower of Nungo is -. To the gratitude of your happy smile. Yes
