I am used to becoming an idol, I want to run, I am happy
Fan & run to the place of the fans, な ん ち ゃ っ っ っ っ っ っ
Sing and dance. It's more difficult than model but fun
How do you see me, now? Well
Well, can I make it cute? Oh, do you look like an idol ♪
This time I am longing to someone. Well, I guess you can get it ♪
Costume is not the main character, I am the protagonist! It is still a mysterious feeling ...
I already gave you the courage to do it out
Maybe it was tall and tall. From the stage you can see far away!
Afterwards if you decorate with the light of the spotlight. Looking forward to it!
If you hold out, touch it, this is an idol
If it delivers cheers, it will be the tailwind!
