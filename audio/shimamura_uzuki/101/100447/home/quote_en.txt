Costumes, stages, fans everyone ... lovely things are alive ♪
Everyone please smile, please. It is a promise of Uzuki 's tea party
If you are pleased, you will want to be more and more excited
Until the person who is the furthest, I firmly serve a smile
Did you make it wink ♪ to the producer?
[Producer] Producer's excitement, please give me
I love ruffled clothes, I love it. I get excited as you wear it ♪
A skirt spreading softly when turning round ... It is a girl's adoration
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
It is an order of pieces. Everyone together, Sue's, peace!
