Because I am, I would like to believe it, there is something to be told
There are passion for the number of sign lights ... It is a scene that seems so
I can do my best with my own thoughts ... If you see something like that ...
Huh ... ... life is a strange thing. I was standing in such a place ...
I can not stand on stage ... because I am not alone. In a single ...
I ... is not strong. I just met [Producer] ...
All right. I am facing forward .... Because I am afraid of running away
The spotlight ... it's warm and dazzling ... tears are coming out
I think that I fell to become special. Have a sad feeling ...
People are not good at it, but if you say it, I'm used to it ...
That day, grasping my hand ... Thank you. Thank you in the future
To the natural smile on stage .... Because it's work ... not only
