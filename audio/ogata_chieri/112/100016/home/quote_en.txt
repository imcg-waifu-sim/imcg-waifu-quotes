Snow ... I wonder if it will pile up. If it is piled up ... it will surely be beautiful
What's wrong? Yeah, Sachiko carrying the cake is cute, too.
Watch your eyes for a moment, maybe you can see Santa ... What. Ahh
Since when. It's so lively ... a smiley Christmas party ...
[Producer] I wonder if I still work at the office ...
[Producer], Merry Christmas. ... Yeah, practicing perfectly
I wonder if it will be getting colder from now .... It was good to be a warm pajamas
Haa ... the glass will cloud soon .... I could write letters, .... Chihaya ...
Wait, Sae chan. Because I will go soon, do not tell me to eat first ~
It's okay if you eat cakes late at night if it's a party, is not it?
Oh, now it is like [Producer] was outside ... Is it due to mind?
The first gift that my Santa gave me ... It was a business card ...
