... The book will tell you a variety of things. It is exactly the teacher of life
At least ... without looking down, straight ahead ...
... In a fantastic costume ... It looks like a princess that comes out in a fairy tale
... Looking at the expression ... everything seems to be exposed out
When you are with a producer ... It seems to be confused than to read a mystery novel
[Producer] 's words are ... more exciting than any character ...
... Smile ... I'm sorry ... I am trying to make an effort, but ...
... After all ... If there is no bangs, I will not feel calm. It is a sex
... I'm sorry ... I am not used to costume yet ... It's embarrassing
... is the story of a girl growing up to adults? It is not even a girl's age
... That, good morning. ... The greeting is a loud voice ... is not it?
Both books and people ... for once in a while ... is not it, [Producer]
