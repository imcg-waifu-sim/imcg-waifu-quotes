If I fall asleep like this ... If it disappears ... why is not it
I will just feel cheap if it comes to words. Wind and warmth
A white room ... If you do not leave from here, I wonder if I can stay innocent
I would like to take care of a girl forever as long as she suffers as an adult ...
When I awoke, [Producer] was there ...
I was locked in ... I do not think so. You may lock up
It was awkward kindness that unleashed the birdcage. Clumsy, breaking open ...
Do not try to reveal with bright light. It will be boring if everything becomes clear
If warmth becomes a matter of course, I can heal my memory ... I wonder if it makes me different
In the same space, dressed in the same outfit. ... But it certainly is a different color. Think about it.
I was awakened by the wind .... The one that caused the wind to blow [Producer] ...
Now, if you extend your fingers, you can touch gentleness .... It is really poisonous to be happy.
