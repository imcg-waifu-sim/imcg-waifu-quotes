I'm good at making cakes. Would you like to have a bite?
Breathing is important, is not it! Same as rice!
Ordinary dishes are burning something ...
For my birthday I also make my own cake ♪
Can I make a cake for [Producer] next?
I feel like making a dessert program, ♪
Huh ... Cream on the cheek ...? That is true ... when did it come ...
When making sweets, it is an apron. If you do not have cream on me ~
Oh, the pinch eating is messy
That knitted off under the apron ...
Eh ... ... when you are with [Producer], you always smile ...?
When touching [Producer], it seems to melt
