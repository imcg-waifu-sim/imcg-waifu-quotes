This is an obnoxious thing, I heard you say ... Mumma, I'm fine
I wonder if the road that I chose is a way to be happy ...
It is a woman who can endure but not to suffer, but to endure it
When I lie down on slick things ... Fah ...
Do you understand what our mind thinks? I'm surely willing to break it up ... ふ ふ ♪
I'm watching from the back one step behind the producer's back
Mayu and Yukari have a cute, sleepy face ... Hehu, did you get up?
Like this hanging out, I want to keep my heart outright
Actually ... The hair is underlaying ... It's moving ...
It is a different color with a different color. Eh, well ... yeah ...
People thinking of a kamehira ... I think my face is getting hot
Beautiful rain burns ... but why do you feel sad?
