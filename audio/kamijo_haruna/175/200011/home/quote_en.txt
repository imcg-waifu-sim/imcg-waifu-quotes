It is a blue and cute costume! Eyewear suitable for this costume ... ...
Somehow, I seem to be nervous ... Oh, ha ha ...
I managed to choreograph somehow! I can stand on stage anytime
Because I am not used to idol costumes ... It's a bit embarrassing
I was ready to become an idol, hang it on the costume I got!
[Producer], please select stage glasses!
Heck? Do not sweat it anymore! Ad libs are weak.
Huhuu, the producer, would you like to wear my glasses? How old are you?
Huh? A ka ... Please stop, I have fingerprints on my glasses
If there is an eyeglass audition, I do not have a passing mistake ...!
How many glasses do you have? Er, usual, for night use, plenty?
Shall we make glasses to request from [Producer] tomorrow â™ª
