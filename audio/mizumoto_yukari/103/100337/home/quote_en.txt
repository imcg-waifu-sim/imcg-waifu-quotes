I will sing with confidence and confidence. To express my world
What a clear stage ... I want to be an innocent idol to meet that ...
My world filled with light ... I wish you a hearty smile
Dance is also part of expression. I left my conscious weakness somewhere
I realized that singing is such a pleasant thing again
The light that [Producer] gave me. How bright it is ...!
I hear you, the voice of joy ... the voice of those who were waiting for me!
As light shines on everything, please take a look at my world without spending!
I feel the power to push my back ... I'm sure it's not my mind
Impression strikes my heart ... But today it is my turn to impress everyone
The theme of the costume is the goddess? Well, [Producer] is God ... why
On the other side of this light [Producer] is watching ...
