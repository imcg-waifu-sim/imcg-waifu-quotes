Cherish every single song, every encounter. Because I want to sing with my whole heart ...
When I start reading the score, I always feel excited ... I love this time
Because it is the duty of the performer to properly read and understand the feelings put in the song
Melo and rust ... It is a musical term I first learned after becoming an idol
Already this time ... stay up late. But ... just a bit more ...
A beautiful moon ... [Producer] is also watching?
I'd like to see the score though ... Is not it an idol song?
Ah ... herbal tea is getting cold. Warm up, milk and honey
Incense received from Saji-chan ... The mind calms down. I have to return this time
It seems that the star is blinking according to the sound ... Huh, it seems she became the conductor of the starry sky
The song I got from [Producer] says a nice gift ...
[Producer], please listen more. My song ...
