It is a costume that imaged the songs sung at this stage ♪ just cute ♪
[Producer] changed me!
I feel like I can do whatever I want to stand on stage!
Well, in my performance ... will you be able to change someone ...?
I'm still on my way to dreaming ... Please, stay with me this time!
Miracle that my dream has come true ... No, thanks to [Producer]
I always thrilled when I wear costumes ♪
When doing chews ... After all when it comes to stage?
When touched ... Uoo ... I do not know what to do ~!
Wearing costumes makes me turn into an idol ... I feel like that
Because I get nervous ... just a little, and hands .... No - it is nothing
It is safe to have a producer for the same thing and not change
