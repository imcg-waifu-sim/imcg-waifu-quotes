Hey, what flower would you like to be? Oh, I still do not know ...
you're not alone. I have a lot of flowers doing my best too
The wind may be blowing to strengthen you. So ... do not lose
do not forget. Those who think that they want to bloom, there are others ...
[Producer] also, always feeling like this, watching us ...?
Next time, I will come and see [Producer]. At that time, surely ...
Happy. Tickle ... ... I will laugh anymore ...
There are petals in this place. Hehe, it's a naughty wind
Please call me a loud voice. Surely ... I can hear it
If I give this knit, I wonder if the wind will shower ...?
[Producer] 's word ... Is Idle giving hope to everyone
[Producer], hands .... Do not worry ... I want you to say
