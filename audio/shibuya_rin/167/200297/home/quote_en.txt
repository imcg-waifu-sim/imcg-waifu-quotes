The rainbow that can be seen from here is sparkling ... There must be a new rainbow ...!
There is no more I who can be swept away. Now I can draw a dream with this hand
I can not stop singing. Because, everyone's smile is there
In the Middle Ages ... we are a friend? ... Uup. It's not a character.
I also watch over the Producer producer
Our story will last, forever. â€¦Right?
I am such a costume, unusual? I do not dislike it, but
I'm not too bad with a smile, are not you? Because there is a best example in the neighborhood
I even cry and make noise. I just do not see it
Every time it moves the ribbon is lovely. It is a decoration for idols
What role am I in the producer's story? You do not have to tell me
STORY we create. I want you to become a character rather than a reader
