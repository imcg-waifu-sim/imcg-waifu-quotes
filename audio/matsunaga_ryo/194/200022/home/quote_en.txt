How long has it been hot in sports? Ever since I played at elementary school?
I have never done lacrosse, but do not joke if I do it with everyone
Miwa's bullish expression, a bit sluggish. That's real.
Playing, I was absorbed. There are also cute things. Oh, kore, off the record
Let's do it together, [Producer] Sun. Please accept me, my pass
The dustiness of the live house, now this moment ... the whole youth of my life
So, you got a good picture? ... Ah, you took it now?
Wind, cool. It's kind of fresh to feel the outside air
When you pass, give a voice first. Do not call me a name.
I did it for a pierced earring. If you chara, it will not be cool
Do you take off-shots? Do not come next door, [Producer] Sun
You have a good face, [Producer] Sun. And what about me?
