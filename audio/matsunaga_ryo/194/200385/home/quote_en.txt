I always ask for new sounds. It is at the instinct level.
I will do any expression. I'm an idol.
Yaru Yuru Yaru. I told you that it was adults
Because it is with members, things that can be created. Surely there was.
Let's mix and sing the soul of me and [Producer]
I am not scared. Because I was taught that there was nothing to be scared of
You became an idol for me, did not you? Well, it's an idol.
Take it from anywhere. When going up to the stage, there is no blind spot
A kirei dress is sometimes not bad .... I will make it even more like this
Do you swing the stick microphone? .... See you next time
I can say it now. Listen to the songs of me. Look at me.
Even if it is the furthest, I can deliver it. [Producer] To Sun
