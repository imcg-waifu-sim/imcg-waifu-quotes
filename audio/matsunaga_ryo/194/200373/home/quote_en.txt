Idol Matsunaga Ryo 's song, let me listen! Now this time I feel numb
There is around the time of the undercard, there is now .... Because the career of regret is different
You are not idle away. This is idle!
It's nostalgic, this lighting, this smell .... Whereabouts of the heart, home ground!
There was also a dream and motivation .... Only one thing was missing, Produce
Watch it. [Producer] An idol monster raised by Sun
Once a leather jacket. Now, the guy who makes fans nailed, the costume of me
Do you have a microphone stand, please? Hey, do not accept it!
To the voice of me, instruments, and calls. That is why this song
Do not hold back, do not shout! The voice of me is not buried under enthusiasm!
Oops, [Producer] It's Sun's GO sign. From here one more step!
Please show me. The stone picked up by you now is ... you become your ideal!
