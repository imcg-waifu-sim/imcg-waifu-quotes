If you sing as it is and scatter it ... even that ...!
Just playing single - singing ... just singing. Because that is my nobility
I want everyone in the fan to know. Violence inside me and feelings I can not stop
You can hear the sound of a bell, a big cheer .... And ... this beat of my chest ...
I can not return anymore, [Producer]. Because I'm a prisoner of the stage
I want you to acknowledge it, not inexorable. [Producer] to
Give me courage. more and more…. As this, sorrowfulness ... will disappear ...
This costume .... Without the elegance as an idol, I can not wear it
I want to be touched .... But I do not want to be touched. Because it seems I will lose
Yeah, I'm yourself but it looks like a different person ... I did not have such a face
…so. Whether it blooms or scattering depends on [Producer] ...
Caught by [Producer] ... I got free.
