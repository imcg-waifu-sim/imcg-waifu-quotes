I like music classes ... but the songs I do at the recital meeting are difficult
Today's homework is math drill and kanji practice ... everyone will do it
I ran for a keyboard harmonica ... what I can practice at home is good
Chie, I can not do it well yet .... I have to practice a lot ...
Well, [Producer] -san ... will you be pleased?
I thought that I wish [Producer] would come
I'm thrilled to be watching it ... like a test .... I will do my bestâ€¦ !
Does it show me a model? Oh, but that's Chiga ...
I use my school bag carefully ... Because my grandma bought me ...
Which one is good. Amu ... Ah, can not sing
If you tell [Producer], you are going to succeed
Because [Producer] can show you where you can not do ...
