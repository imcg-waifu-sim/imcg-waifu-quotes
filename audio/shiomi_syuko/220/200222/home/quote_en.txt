Stylish sound, good! The store in my parents' house is flowing like a Japanese style song
I am hungry? This, New Orleans · Pizza, eat ♪
[Producer] and two people, on the contrary feeling alone
If you did not have [Producer], you could not have your store closed
This is not alcohol. Straight juice · no chaser ♪

Swing, swing ♪ That's it. I'm trying to shake it.
