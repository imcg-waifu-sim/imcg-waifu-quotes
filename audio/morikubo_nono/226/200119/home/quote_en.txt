I feel like I'm gonna eat when I look at people ...
You did not need a new costume .... No, it's a nice costume ...
I like chicken feathers ... It does not matter to costumes ...
Smile ... cheeks are likely to cling .... Only the face is trained ... Face Macho ...
Why am I ... keeping the idol ...? Well ...
Can you see it as an idol?
thinâ€¦? I never mind ...
Even in gorgeous costumes ... Megambo is a burning mood ...
Oh, I understand .... I will quit an idol ... Eh? Is it wrong?
I am looking at the camera's eyes ... My face is hot ...
I think that I can not be like an idol ... if that's okay ...
I can not easily change it ... maybe I just changed a bit ...
