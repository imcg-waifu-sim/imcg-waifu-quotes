Uu ... I do not want to go .... I will live here anymore ... Yes ...
I can not do a job of solo stage on my throat ... I can not ... OK

[Producer] Watching producer's eyes ... Mu ...
Even if pulled ... Wait ... From here ... Do not move ...
Even if my tears are wiped ... Uu ... Thank you very much ...

What I can do for my gut ... to write a poem ... about to hide ...
Why, wherever you are ... will you find ...? I feel sorry.
[Producer] From the producer ... I can not escape ...
