The dream I first wrote was "I want to quit" .... But ... because it was a lie, please erase it ...
Would you also read the story? It is a story that the bear did not notice in the forest ...
Sorry ... the letter is small .... Plus, I'm afraid so ... trembling ...
A dream of an idol .... I'm cheeky with a cheek of hunting but ... in a small dream ...
[Producer] Only homework done by the producer ...
Tell people what you want to do ... for the first time .... Perhaps, this is the end ...
What is in here ... Forest picture book .... I usually live in this world ...
Oh no, do you turn it over? Only, that you can read in the place you are seeing ...
I always ask for milk tea .... It also has a gentle taste for the gourds ...
Even if I gaze at you ... I do not see it. Secretly when I'm not stared ... I do not see ...
[Producer] To the producer ... I will not die even if touched
[Producer] Buckwheat noodle by producer ... It looks like sunshine in the forest ...
