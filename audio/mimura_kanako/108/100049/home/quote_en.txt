I feel a little tearful when I think I've come so far
I will do my best to make magic for everyone
When I sing at the stage, my chest is full with everyone's smile ...
Fans, thank you for the cheers ...!
If I am shining, thanks to [Producer] san ...
[Producer], please spell even more!
Yes! Are you nervous? Sure, a bit ... but I'm fine
Well, I know you always push your back
Yes ... through this costume ... I swear to do my best!
Is it a hat? Oh, it's true, I am out of alignment. Thank you
[Producer], I feel tickled when touched by a shoulder
It's okay. Please come back when you come back
