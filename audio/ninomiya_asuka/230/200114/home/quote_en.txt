Is it the devil? It is not the object of faith, but think that it is interesting
Mephistopheres ... I definitely want to see you
Haha ... I have found it. Or did you want you to find it ...
I feel like a star is calling. The book that I came out with one hand
From who 's point of view you read this story ... Interesting
Sharing the Sekai ... I think you have much courage to surrender your soul
Perhaps I am losing because I am getting it. You and me ... everyone
Was it fate to make mad, or was it crazy from the beginning ...
Oh, it's in German ... I can feel it even if I can not read it
The night wind is comfortable .... How about sitting down? Is not it a bad day?
Rather than following the story ... Shall we create it? Tell me, the story of yours
Do you want me to drag it on that road ... did you make such a bet as God?
