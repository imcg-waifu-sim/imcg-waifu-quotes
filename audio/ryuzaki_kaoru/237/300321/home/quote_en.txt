In Kaoru everyone is okay because there are fellows!
The color of Kaoru was a long bunch! Everyone popped up and bloomed!
Cheerfully, pretty, then it seems to go crazy!
Does everyone become friends of Kaoru? Well
I wish you all the happiness of everyone's happiness, Kaoru!
I know wherever you are, so I can go on to Kaoru!
I can be happy when ladybirds stop. Hey, Kaoru!
I practiced to run faster! I wanted to run to the top!
Today it is not a pop band! Hey, is it hungry?
The feeling is also stuck in the venue and it is clogged. Kaoru also put it in the song!
Kaoru, are you getting big? Because the teacher made a big deal â™ª
When you smile, Kaoru is happy and will laugh!
