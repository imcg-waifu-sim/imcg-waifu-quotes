I wish a week would have been three days ... then 3 days a week?
Kyou, I aim for "an idol that I do not have to sing and dance"!
Even if I become an idol, it will not be easy for me to live. Watch your hands peacefully ...
I wish birthday of everyone in the office was a whole holiday ...
What is the royalty of CDs? Hey, [Producer] producer
I am in trouble. [Producer] Producer, I gotta work so much
I will do it when I do it. I gotta get caught in a single shot, it's a pain
Huh ... I finally got it ... I naming it "How do you pretend to work and sleep"!
Yeah, it's burning, Melamella ... the flame of inability to work ...!
Lesson sorting? I do not have to do such a nature idol ~
[Producer] Producer, is the royal tax still ~?
[Producer] Producer, exhausted, I will take a break!
