Lyrics of flowers. It's a buttony, so it should be easy to grab ...
Truly Shiki is also a joker. This time, right?
Hope. I do not understand such feelings. I myself wish, Mama ...
I can do a child .... When it is difficult, I manage to do something Genius!
Hey assistant Kun, can you give me advice? If you do, you can see something
Did you know that I fight hard? So fast the entry time ...
Fu ~, I sweat, Thank you .... It might be the first time for such difficulties
A place to stand, more behind ...? Oh, I guess it was too much obscurity
Tummy push! Push! Sound pressure, just a little
Funaba ~, I can not resist now even if I do anything. Shiki, hello hello ...
Yeah. Meet with you ... Every day after that ... Hints for hope ...?
... Thank you for seeing it. Somewhat, I remembered the old days. Why?
