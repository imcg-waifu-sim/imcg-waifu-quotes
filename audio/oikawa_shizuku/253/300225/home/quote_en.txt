Well, my heart is pounding with my heart pounding! My cheeks go on!
I will deliver my song to cattle too! Delicious milk may be squeezed?
I am not relaxing today, I will show you! Please watch me
A new scenery is always waiting for where the wind blows!
Now is an idol running around the stage! Well, come on together!
The way of idol is OK if you are [Producer]!
I will not give you a hat. Because I'm planning to throw into the fans at the encore!
Throw a rope and catch you ... ... this is a microphone code
Bell on a cow handle, country style ... this is a cowgirl, is not it â™ª
Even if tightened with a belt it is OK!
[Producer] also excites me? I ... ... Hey!
The wink is a signal for "Thank you". Please do not miss it
