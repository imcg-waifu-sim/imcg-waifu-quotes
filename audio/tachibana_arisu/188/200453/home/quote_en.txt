Like chocolate, we will deliver the time to bless happiness
Everyone, do you like sweet candy? ... Do you like sweet idols, too?
A little bitter that complements sweetness. That is the taste of adults. In other words? It is me
If I eat this cake, will the body grow bigger ...
I will give you a bit of sweet time for [Producer] as well
Let's put your feelings into songs, sweets. Feelings to care for your opponent
When you are at this stage ... hungry ... No, nothing
It is a fancy set. It seems that he really became the hero of a fairy tale ...
Even though it is always a blue light, today is a pink color ... this is also beautiful

In front of [Producer] ... I want to be a bit bitter.
I am not doing much tension ... Because it is a fun tea party
