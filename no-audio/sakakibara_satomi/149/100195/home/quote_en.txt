If you become an idol, can you do more various things ... Sorry
I want to see fans soon. I want to go closer

Okay ... What is it, I wonder why? That ~ ...
But I made a mistake ... I have to fix it ... It is not clumsy ~
Have my arm ...? Is this how it is? Tutto ... ha ...
This costume ... It looks like a fairy's clothes appearing in a picture book ~
