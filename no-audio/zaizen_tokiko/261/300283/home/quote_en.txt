My charm is not such a thing. Still more ... Cook
Please shed tears and rejoice. Because I am seeing my idol figure
Am I singing? First of all, sing a praising song, you
I wonder if the aim is to top. It is the apex of all human beings.
It's fun. To discipline, make me cry, teach joy ... very pleasant
It is not bad for your sense .... I have to give a reward ...
You can see it even if you hide it. Do you like this kind of thing?
This whip, do not be afraid. What do you want?
You can touch it. Instead, what happens ... You know what?
Right on. I will allow you to see me .... Tell us your impressions
that's right. Worship me more. Because I will be pretty
I will tell you the taste of this whip, first of all. Please rejoice.
