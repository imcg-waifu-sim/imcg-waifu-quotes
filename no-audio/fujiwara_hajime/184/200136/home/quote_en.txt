It is told that I am stubborn ... Yes, my grandfather ...
Bizen's pottery is the best in Japan! Shall I explain the features
Excuse me. I have to attach a lesson. Not deftly
Common point between pottery and idol ... Can you find it?
As instruments, I will do my best to be one thing in the world
What kind of pottery do you like [Producer]?
As usual, what kind of clothes would you have ...? I do not have much cute clothes ...
Even if it gets caught ... what should I do ...? I am in trouble. Could you please

I am in trouble to unwind a string. [Producer]
What is it to say thank you for being indebted, but please ... use a cup
I'm an idol [Producer] will shape you
