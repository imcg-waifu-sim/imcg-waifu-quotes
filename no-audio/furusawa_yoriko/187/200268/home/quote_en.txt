I am a high school student. It is often said that it is calm ...
I like going to museums. I feel like I can enter another world
I think I want to change, but it is difficult. I am not inconvenient.
Being an idol means that I will be subject to someone's beauty ...?
What kind of picture is [Producer] 's favorite picture ... Impressionist ...?
[Producer], this time ... museum ... no, nothing
Such clothes are usually not so much .... I want to try a little fancy
I have never contacted you. There is a yearning, but I am a bit scared
Good posture ...? Oh, well said .... It is a habit
It takes courage to reach for admiration ... but I do not have that courage ...
I was glad to hear your voice. I think now, but ...
A smile ... is it? [Producer], is it your choice ...?
