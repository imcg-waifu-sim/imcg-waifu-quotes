I am planning to do both singing and playing! I do not know yet!
While I am, the atmosphere is different from usual ... professional power is amazing!
Friends wanted to find what they wanted to do ... Well, was it okay?
I wonder what to write in the occupation column. Idol ... or performing arts relations?
I will show you to [Producer]! Promised by two people â™ª
I have plenty of time to have [Producer]!
First off, I will show off my cool parents ... It is cute again next time!
Is not it a good battle expression, too? When showing the results of the lesson ...!
He also took in me the attitude of costumes .... That suits?
I got you permed! If you dance, your hair may look like dancing!
Combination is important for dancing ... Idol is also Kana!
Hold your hand, [Producer]! Dance with me?
