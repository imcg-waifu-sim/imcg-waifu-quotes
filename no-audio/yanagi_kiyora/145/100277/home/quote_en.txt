I will sing so that I can heal many people. Listen!
I do not show anxiety. I do not want to worry the person I saw
With a cheerful smile. Yes, it was the most important thing in the nurse era
I hope sick people and injured people will not appear during work at idle ...
I, [Producer] producer heal me
[Producer] The producer also got better?
Oh my, touches that place .... Well then, me too ♪
It is not an angel of white coat anymore. I want to become an angel more ♪
It is better not to accumulate stress .... Shall we cry out with this microphone?
It's been a long time since I unwinding my hair at work. There is sense of freedom
It is safe to have a person leaning back. It may not be able to return anymore
It is enough for one person to know within my breast
