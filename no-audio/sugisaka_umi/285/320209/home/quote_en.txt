Do you look like a dancer? Hehe, it is an idol
You will change the atmosphere when unraveling your hair. Huhu, is not it?
Carefully to the fingertip ... passionately finess, so look
I use a butterfly as a motif. If this costume, I will also fly away!
Do you feel nostalgic? ... I guess I like the sea here
Both wind and fever are all here right now ... I will chase my dreams
I also like to decorate, but it is also nice to dress myself. More decorate
Is the waist ...? Hey ... that gaze is obnoxious
Even this is quite hard work. If only a little, you can check it
Glittering ...? Is it accessory? Or maybe there?
Next time I will wind up the wind. Towards fans
Like the sunset seen in the sea, the back of my heart is burning
