When becoming an idol, can you become more cute ~? Really?
My hobbies are nail and esthetic something. I want to become more kawaii ~
It might be good to wear hair. Hey, this is also well wound up
It is often said that you are a good curious person. It might be because of Mama's education ~
I will do it for you if you go crazy. I wonder if it will become a bad thing ~
I do not want to do it, but I want people to like me ~
This dress is at party. Dad bought me a dad ~
It is going to sell. It is cute when it gets serious ~. Hey, how about ~?
I was modeling sometimes in a magazine. It's a glittering magazine guy ~
I know many things in appearance. Let me be beautiful
