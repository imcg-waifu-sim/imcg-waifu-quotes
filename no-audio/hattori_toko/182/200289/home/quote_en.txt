I can smile .... What does not change as last chance
Even with all its scratches, I will laugh. Idols will give dreams
I do not believe her talent for words. Do not rely too much on excuses
I can do what I was asked for perfectly. My mind
It might not be a dream to become top if you are with me .... You can trust me ...?
If you believe from such a heart, you can not return anymore ...
Oh, it was a bad thing ...? Can you give me back?
I know the weight of opportunity given .... This is a strength.
People can not stand alone. Because there are people who can support, you can stand
I will hold my heart. I am the idol I had you produce for me
You can believe it. I can say that with my heart breaking now.
It is a special thing that there are some people who expect me .... Even if it is heavy, it's okay.
