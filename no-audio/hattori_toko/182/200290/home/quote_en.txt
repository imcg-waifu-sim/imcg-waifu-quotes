Not everyone can trust their dreams .... It is natural that you become an adult
I got tired to be betrayed. Still, you say you should believe it
I made an effort. But, I did not have the talent .... It's an excuse, is not it.
If it does not work this time, it is already .... Age you think reasonably
Producer could believe it .... Can I believe it?
My last chance, I'll call you. I count on you.
I did not even decorate it before I knew ... .... I wonder if she is disqualified before an idol
I used to have confidence in my old days, but now it is not at all .... Rather, reverse
last chanceâ€¦. When you try it, there is weight
Sometimes I was bathed in terrible words ... It was a good experience as well.
I will expect you, if you do it so diligently. ... I wonder if my dream will come true
If the producer expects me, I feel I can do my best ... once again ...
