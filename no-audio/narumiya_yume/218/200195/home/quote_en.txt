A picture-fairy fairy .... It seems like I will be like this ...
... Is there a lesson of a lesson that will make you fairies ...?
Overflowing feelings ... leave as it is. Because it's important ...
Talent is ... I do not understand well. But a little fun ...
[Producer], if you can also idle ...
Idol is ... to have a look, it has meaning for the first time ... I see ...
This costume is ... fairy .... Delivering a dream ... fairy ...
I am ashamed to show the picture yet. But ...
I will not hide it. ... If you do not see it, it makes no sense
To make a picture with depth, overlay the colors .... If it was an idol, was it an experience ...?
The world trapped in the sketchbook ... It seems that it spreads out more
Because he taught me the art of telling my world .... Thank you
