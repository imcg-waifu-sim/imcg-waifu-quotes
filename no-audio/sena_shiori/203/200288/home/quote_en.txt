The sea is my hometown .... I was there since I was born
The ocean is connected, but the sea at home is the best ...
I was born and bred and grew up on a small island, because people are ignorant ... forgive me for being strange
It is not something I am looking at ... What I will go forward ... How I got such an idea
If I did not meet [Producer] ... life was calm
[Producer] 's eyes are clear like a clear ocean
Only drifting. Well, I have spent all this time
I need to wear a hat. I get red when I get sunburned ...
If you are kind as sea breeze, you do not mind being touched?
The wind is strong here, too. Oh, you do not feel it?
Will you sink in my depth, will you scoop up ...?
Even though I have been walking while cheating. It seems I will not pass it to you ...
