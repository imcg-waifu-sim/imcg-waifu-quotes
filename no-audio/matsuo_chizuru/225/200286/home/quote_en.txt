I was not interested in idols. ... ... I never even thought about it
If it is study, as it is. It has been said strictly
It is a habit to have many soliloquies. please do not worry. Do not worry
Well, learning new things is fun. ...... So is it an idol?
...... I wonder what I can do idle. I want to do it ... Ha!
I feel like I changed a bit, as you said. â€¦just a little
The dress is tight. Uniform is not like something to bring out personality
Were the tie loose? I wonder if I'm relaxed.
Do not tease. ...... Because I do not know what to do ... huh
Is the expression soft? ...... If that can be done, not having any difficulties
May I tell you about your story if it is a little bit?
By the way, where am I going to be idle? Let me know for yourself?
