I will make your heart moist. Like the sea ~
Do you keep fish? Or will you eat ~? Which one do you like?
My father went out for tuna swimming fishing and stayed as it was ... I came back ~
What kind of fish can be taken in the urban ocean?
If you go with a producer, can you see a new sea or fish?
Producer is like a sea, a person with a wide mind is good ~
This child's name is Sabaori Kun! It's pretty facial ~
Asarase Nanami. I like this name, ~. I heard that the grandpa put on it ~
There are lots of oceanographic books at home ~. There was no idol picture book ~
Use raw materials to sashimi ~. Well, I will lose the Nanami! ... Ki, cut it?
Sabaori - kun, please hold your hug ~. It matches well well ~
Producer has a cute part like Sabaori ~
