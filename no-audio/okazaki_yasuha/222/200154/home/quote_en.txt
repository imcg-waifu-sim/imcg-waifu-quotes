I have been living in the entertainment world since I was a child. I understand
Idol and model ... Are there many different things?
When I become an idol, I wonder if I can change something .... I do not know something
I wonder if I could have been an ordinary girl if I did not enter the entertainment world ...
I will do my best with all my power ... this feeling, it may be the first time in a long while
I mean I can idle ... ... Do you believe me?
Nothing is funny ... Nature is the most difficult ...
I do not want to lose to anyone ... If I lose, I will end there
I think that professionalism is necessary. Because there are people who need it
If I get lost I'm afraid ... I got lost ... I'm sorry
As it changes little by little ... Can you draw hands?
One step to find something ... The chance was [Producer]
