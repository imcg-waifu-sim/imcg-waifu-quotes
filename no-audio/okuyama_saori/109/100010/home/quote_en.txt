It is plain, is not it. But I aim for my idol and I will do my best
Um, what kind of lesson are you having today? Wonder, I will do anything
Well, idol's job, I am nervous, but I am looking forward to it
[Producer], Produce by Wadase I will do
[Producer] 's instructions, I will keep it firmly
This bear's hair stopper is my favorite.
Is braid like plain?
Is it a book? I'm fond of reading
I am nervous ... I'm not good at talking too much
Well, it's fun to talk to [Producer]
I really appreciate it for your support
