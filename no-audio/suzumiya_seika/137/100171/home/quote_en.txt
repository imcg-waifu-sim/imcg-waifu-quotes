Now this singing voice will be proud of me
I want to be able to play various sounds besides classical sounds
I also told my father. ... OK, I will let you admit it
Fortunately, I am used to the stage. Dignifiedly, with a smile. I will go.
I will sing a song with my feelings for [Producer] like you.
I'd like to find [Producer] and I'm proud
I can be proud that I can wear this costume ♪ ♪
Playing the costume's violin ... ... It's ticklish, is not it
I will play as I told you. If you can do that, freely ...
I want to dance according to the tone .... It is such a costume
I am a nation - conscious person, can you walk with me? ... take your hand
It was my first time to have such a feeling ... [Producer], sir.
