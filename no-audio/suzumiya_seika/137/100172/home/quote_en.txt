First, one song .... It is my special skill
The accumulation of practice produces a glittering sound. Is it the same as idle?
I want to know better the world and play better. That is my hope
It is encouraging to have someone to tell me. May I have some instructions
Thank you very much. Hello [Producer],
Mr. Producer ... Even if you call [Producer] like a proof of dear?
This violin was kindly given to you by your father
I taught my mother how to play. Elegantly ... dignified ...
This costume is for presentation. It is for playing in public.
The violin played throughout the body. Dance my hair and let my heart beat ...
One song for [Producer] sama ... Because it plays, please listen
The sound of [Producer] -sama's heart ... It must be beautiful and surely wonderful
