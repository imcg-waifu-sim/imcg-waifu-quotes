I have to take more lessons ... I must be confident, I can not laugh
When I'm having fun I am laughing a lot. Even if I draw him, I am now.
Both songs, dances and smiles ... I tried hard on everything, but I do not know for myself
This access is all handmade ... Can I tell everyone in the fans?
I tried my best and laughed when I laughed ... I was able to do it properly ...
When I can laugh, I want to be laughable next time ...
Such a nice costume ... I wore it for the first time in my life ...
A person's letter to Odeco so as not to be nervous ...? I have never heard of it ...
Toward this microphone, let everyone's feelings ... Oh, MC, practicing ...
Something looks sparkling ... Because the surroundings changed? Or am I?
Deliver the best smile to everyone in the fans! You can do it
It is the most embarrassing thing to be said to be cute! ... but thanks ...
